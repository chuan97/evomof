Optimization tools for the numerical construction of maximally orthogonal frames (MOFs), 
in particular Grassmannian frames/optimal packings in complex space.

Work in progress. 

It currently features a projection-based CMA-ES routine (using [pycma](https://github.com/CMA-ES/pycma)) as a global optimizer,
and a conjugate gradient routine (based on [pymanop](https://github.com/pymanopt/pymanopt)) as a local optimizer.
